# Gestational diabetes prediction
The Prima Indian Diabetes Dataset has been used in this project, provided by kaggle. The dataset has been originally collected from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset consists of some medical data, such as pregnancy record, BMI, insulin level, age, glucose level, blood pressure,  skin thickness, diabetes pedigree function etc. This dataset has 768 patient’s data where all the patients are female. The number of true cases are 268 (34.90%) and the number of false cases are 500 (65.10%), respectively, in the dataset. I used Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning model earlier prediction. This project also aims to propose an effective technique for earlier detection of the diabetes disease using Machine learning algorithms and deployment using gradio UI.
